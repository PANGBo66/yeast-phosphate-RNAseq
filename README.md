# RNA-seq Analysis of Phosphate Starvation in Yeast

üöÄ Project Overview
To elucidate the transcriptional adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to phosphate starvation, I performed a comparative RNA-seq analysis of yeast under phosphate-sufficient and phosphate-deficient conditions. High-quality sequencing data were subjected to a standard bioinformatics pipeline, including alignment with STAR, differential expression analysis using DESeq2, and functional enrichment with cluster Profiler. 

ü§ñ Note on Code Generation
**Transparency Statement:** This project was a significant learning journey for me in computational biology. As I was new to R and bioinformatics programming, I extensively utilized **AI-assisted tools (including GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT)** to help me write, debug, and understand the code for packages like `DESeq2` and `clusterProfiler`.

The focus was on correctly applying these established methods to solve a biological problem, rather than on writing complex algorithms from scratch. All code has been thoroughly reviewed and executed by me and my supervisor Prof. ZHANG to ensure its functionality and to derive the biological insights presented in the report.
